## Fitness Tracker: A Usage Trends Analysis

### Theme 
Human temporal routine behavioral analysis and pattern recognition.

### Questions
We propose a tool **FitMe** that allows you to feed in your smart watch data to provide you with answer to questions
* How active are your days? Do you spend a considerable amount of time being sedentary?
* How does this data vary on weekdays vs weekends?
* What factors contribute to the highest calorie burn?
* Have you been following a steady sleep schedule? What factors influence it?
* Understand the sleep stages and find out what it takes to get a better deep sleep.
* What is the impact of a Netflix binge on weekend sleep?
* Use Machine Learning to see if there is a hidden pattern to attain better sleep

### Goal
The end product will be a tool that functions as described above. We will host it on the Cloud with an ML model and EDA pipelines running in the background. 

### Data sources
The [FitBit Fitness Tracker Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/fitbit) is a rich collection of 18 different csv files that collates information about daily activities, calorie, heartrate, sleep cycles, intensities and steps, among others.
